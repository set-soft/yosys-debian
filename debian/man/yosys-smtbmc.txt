NAME
  yosys-smtbmc - write design to SMT2-LIBv2 file

SYNOPSIS
  yosys-smtbmc [options] <yosys_smt2_output>

OPTIONS

  -t [<skip_steps>:]<num_steps>  
      default: skip_steps=0, num_steps=20

  -u <start_step>  
      assume asserts in skipped steps in BMC

  -S <step_size>  
      proof <step_size> time steps at once

  -c <vcd_filename>  
      write counter-example to this VCD file (hint: use 'write_smt2
      -wires' for maximum coverage of signals in generated VCD file)

  -i  
      instead of BMC run temporal induction

  -m <module_name>  
      name of the top module

  -s <solver>  
      Set SMT solver: z3, cvc4, yices, mathsat. default: z3
